Machine learning algos for practice

The algorithms I'm using are part of Coursera's ML course by one of the amazing guys, Andrew Ng!


Algorithms are implemented using Octave, a high level programming language for scientific numerical computations. Math guys will definitely love this tool, give it a shot and it is part of GNU.

Happy Coding! :)
