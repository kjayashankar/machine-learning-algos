Machine learning algos for practice

The algorithms I'm using are part of Coursera's ML course by one of the amazing guys, Andrew Ng!

These algorithms are optional assignments from the course. Graded tasks are not posted because of Code of Honour.

Algorithms are implemented using Octave, a high level programming language for scientific numerical computations. Math guys will definitely love this tool, give it a shot and it is part of GNU.

Happy Coding! :)
